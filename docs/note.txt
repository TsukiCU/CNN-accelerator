I am recording some notes during development.
Delete me after everything is done, and start writing real docs.

cd tests

./test_memory

the Memory Allocation Section deals with :
1. Memory block allocation and deallocation regardless of device.
2. Data transfering between CPU and GPU.
3. Concurrency. No data racing should occur.
4. Memory Alignment for optimized performance.
5. Thorough Log information.

TODO : 3,4,5.

Issues:
1. It's kind of weird that memory is a .cu file. Not sure if there is a better way of doing this.
2. Should initializing with a size of 0: For CPU, ptr_ is not nullptr since malloc will return a
   pointer regardless of size, but for GPU, ptr_ will be nullptr. Don't know if this is fine.
3. Unit testing files should include large memory allocation scenarios. Not implemented yet.
